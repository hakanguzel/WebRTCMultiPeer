# WebRTC Multi Peer Video Connection

This demo shows you how to do a simple WebRTC Multi Peer Video Connection app using NodeJs.

This library creates a traditional multi-peer communication using a single signaling server. Videos are added to the screen as users join and accept use of their cameras and microphones. As users disconnect, their videos are removed from all sessions.
